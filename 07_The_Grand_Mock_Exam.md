*   **Q9: A (10/21)**
*   **Q10: A (5:24)**
*   **Q11: B (22)**
*   **Q12: A (Friday)**
*   **Q13: B (49)**
*   Squares: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... Next is 7^2 = **49**.

*   **Q14: D (Neither)**
*   Cars -> Cats <- Fans. No direct link Cars-Fans.

*   **Q15: C (HS BQ F)**
*   +1 shift. G->H, R->S, A->B...

*   **Q16: A (28.57)**
*   (26*20 + 30*36) / (26+30) = (520+1080)/56 = 1600/56 = 28.57.

*   **Q17: A (15)**
*   3x/5x -> (3x+10)/(5x+10) = 5/7 -> 21x+70 = 25x+50 -> 4x=20 -> x=5. A = 15.

*   **Q18: B (1760)**
*   CP = 1440/0.9 = 1600. SP needed = 1600 * 1.1 = 1760.

*   **Q19: B (2:1)**
*   Standard Alligation Rule.

*   **Q20: B (16)**
*   F=3S. (3S-8) = 5(S-8). -> 3S-8 = 5S-40 -> 2S=32 -> S=16.

*   **Q21: C (331)**
*   SI=300 -> P*3*10/100=300 -> P=1000.
*   CI = 1000 * (1.1)^3 - 1000 = 1331 - 1000 = 331.

*   **Q22: A (8%)**
*   100 -> 120 -> 10% discount = 108. Gain 8.

*   **Q23: C (150)**
*   25x + 20x + 15x = 3000 (paise). 60x=3000 -> x=50. 5p coins = 3x = 150.

*   **Q24: B (35)**
*   Total=135. New Total=100. Diff=35.

*   **Q25: B (4 hours)**
*   Downstream Speed = 13+4=17. Time = 68/17 = 4.

## B. Technical Core
*   **Q26: B (Context Free)** - Equal count requires a stack (memory). DFA cannot do it.
*   **Q27: B (Regular)** - DFAs define Regular languages.
*   **Q28: C (Halting Problem)** - Classic undecidable problem.
*   **Q29: B (Not Regular)** - Pumping Lemma is a negative test.
*   **Q30: C (Context Sensitive)** - Matching 3 counts (a,b,c) uses CSG (or Turing Machine).
*   **Q31: C (X is superkey)** - BCNF removes functional dependency where LHS is not a candidate key.
*   **Q32: B (DELETE)** - It is DML (logged). TRUNCATE is DDL (min logging).
*   **Q33: B (Plan)**.
*   **Q34: D (Durability)**.
*   **Q35: D (Inner)**.
*   **Q36: A (Insert/Update)** - Because indexes must be re-balanced on write.
*   **Q37: A (Dirty Read)**.
*   **Q38: B (FIFO)** - More frames = More page faults (sometimes).
*   **Q39: B (ps aux)**.
*   **Q40: B (Binary Sem)**.
*   **Q41: B (Circular Wait)**.
*   **Q42: A (Paging)**.
*   **Q43: A (Seek Time)**.
*   **Q44: B (Open/Closed)**.
*   **Q45: C (Interfaces)**.
*   **Q46: B (Friends/Inner)** - Not child classes (Protected).
*   **Q47: B (Overloading)** - Static binding.
*   **Q48: B (O(n))** - Building heap is linear time using `heapify`.
*   **Q49: C (In-order)** - Sorted order.
*   **Q50: B (Negative Edges)** - Bellman Ford is needed there.
*   **Q51: B (Recursion)**.
*   **Q52: B (Sorted)** - Pivot becomes minimum/maximum. O(n^2).
*   **Q53: D (All)**.

## C. Output
*   **Q54: B** (Ref modify).
*   **Q55: B** (18).
*   **Q56: A** (Concat).
*   **Q57: B** (False).
*   **Q58: D** (Undefined).
*   **Q59: B (false, true)** - `==` checks reference, `.equals` checks content.
*   **Q60: A (ACD)** - Exception happens at `B`, catches `C`, finally `D`.
*   **Q61: B (B)** - Runtime polymorphism (Overriding).
*   **Q62: B (StaticInstanceConstructor)** - Static loads once class loads. Instance loads before constructor.
*   **Q63: C (true false)** - Java caches Integers -128 to 127. 200 is new object.
*   **Q64: B (11)** - `5 + 1 * 5 + 1` = 5 + 5 + 1 = 11. (Missing parenthesis macro trap).
*   **Q65: B (20)** - References are aliases.
*   **Q66: B (20)** - `*(p+1)` moves pointer to index 1.
*   **Q67: D (All)**.
*   **Q68: A (4 5)** - `sizeof` is compile time. Side effect `x++` never happens.
*   **Q69: B ([1], [1, 2])** - Mutable default argument trap.
*   **Q70: C (True False)** - All empty is vacuously true. Any empty is false.
*   **Q71: A (Mello)** - Stack strings are mutable.
*   **Q72: C (SegFault)** - String literals are read-only memory.
*   **Q73: A (321123)** - Pre code vs Post code.
*   **Q79:** JS coercion is wild.
*   **Q97:** Bitwise left shift `1 * 2^3`.
