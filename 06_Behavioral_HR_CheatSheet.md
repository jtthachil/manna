## 🌟 The Magic Framework: STAR Method
Whenever asked a story-based question, follow this precise structure:

1.  **S - Situation:** Set the scene (20s). "In my final year project, we were building a Payment app..."
2.  **T - Task:** What happened? (10s). "Suddenly, the API we were using deprecated a feature 2 days before the demo."
3.  **A - Action:** What did YOU do? (Spend 70% time here). "I researched alternatives, found a library, pulled an all-nighter to refactor the wrapper class..."
4.  **R - Result:** The happy ending. "We deployed on time, and the professor specifically praised the clean API integration."

## 🗣️ Common KeyValue / CoFee Questions

### 1. "Why KeyValue?"
*   **Bad Answer:** "I need a job." / "You pay well."
*   **Good Answer:** "I've been following the tech scene in Kochi, and KeyValue stands out for building actual products like CoFee, not just service projects. I want to work in a product-focused environment where code quality matters."

### 2. "Tell me your weakness."
*   **Trap:** Don't say "I work too hard" (Fake) or "I am lazy" (Too honest).
*   **Real Answer:** "I sometimes struggle to say no to extra tasks, which can affect my bandwidth. I'm using a Trello board now to visualize my load and manage expectations better." (Weakness + Fix).

### 3. "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"
*   **Answer:** "I want to be a Senior SDE who owns a complete module of a product like CoFee, from design to deployment, and mentoring juniors."

### 4. "Handle a conflict scenario."
*   **Scenario:** Teammate wrote bad code.
*   **Answer:** "I wouldn't call them out in public. I'd leave comments on the Pull Request explaining *why* it might fail, and offer to pair-program to fix it together. Focus on the code, not the person."

## ❓ Questions YOU should ask THEM
(Asking questions shows you are smart and interested).

1.  "What does the typical feedback cycle look like for a new joiner?"
2.  "Will I be working on the CoFee product or client service projects?"
3.  "What is the tech stack for your latest internal tools?"
