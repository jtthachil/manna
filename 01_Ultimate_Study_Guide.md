## 📅 Roadmap (3-4 Weeks)

*   **Week 1: Foundations** -> Python DSA (Arrays, HashMaps), SQL Basics, Aptitude (Speed).
*   **Week 2: Advanced DSA** -> Trees, Graphs, Recursion.
*   **Week 3: System Design & DB** -> "CoFee" App Design, Scaling, SQL vs NoSQL.
*   **Week 4: Mock Mode** -> Full timed tests.

## 🧐 Terminology "Gotchas" (Clarified)

Don't let these confuse you in the interview!

### 1. "1.5 NF" / "2.5 NF" (Does not exist)
You likely heard **1NF** (Atomic), **2NF** (No Partial Dep), **3NF** (No Transitive Dep).

### 2. "UCI" (Likely UML)
**UML (Unified Modeling Language):** Standard for drawing Class/Sequence diagrams.

### 3. "SDLC" (Software Development Life Cycle)
Requirement -> Design -> Implementation -> Testing -> Deployment -> Maintenance.

## 📄 The 30-Second Resume Scan (Fix this NOW)
*   **Tech Stack:** Put "Python, SQL, React Native (learning)" at the top.
*   **Projects:** Don't just list titles.
    *   *Bad:* "Library Management System."
    *   *Good:* "Library System handling **1000+ books** using **B-Tree indexing** for fast search." (Add numbers!).
*   **Links:** Ensure GitHub link works.

## 🚫 "Stay Out of Trouble" Checklist (Round 1)

1.  **Do NOT switch tabs.** The test platform tracks focus.
2.  **Read BOTH coding questions first.** Detailed scenario questions can be long but easy.
3.  **Output Format Matters.** If they ask to return string "Yes", don't return boolean `True`.
4.  **Edge Cases:** Check for Empty `[]`, Negative `-1`, Large `10^9`.

## 💡 The "Day Before" Cheat Sheet
*   **Sleep:** 8 hours. Brain fog kills coding speed.
*   **Setup:** Check webcam, mic, and internet 1 hour before.
*   **Paper:** Keep pen and paper ready for tracing logic (Recursion trees).
*   **Water:** Keep a bottle next to you.

## 🤝 Salary & HR Negotiation 101
*   **Q:** "What is your expected salary?"
*   **A (Safe):** "I am open to industry standards for fresher SDE roles. My priority is the learning curve and product culture at KeyValue."
*   **A (If forced):** "Based on my research, 4-6 LPA is standard. I'm looking in that range."
